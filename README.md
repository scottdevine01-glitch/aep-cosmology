# AEP Cosmic Superfluid Theory - Code Repository

This repository contains the code and data for the paper:

**"The Anti-Entropic Principle and the Two-Field Cosmic Superfluid: A Unified Theory from Primordial Coupling to Late-Time Dissipation"**

by Scott Devine

## Overview

This code provides the implementation for the Two-Field Cosmic Superfluid theory derived from the Anti-Entropic Principle (AEP). The theory predicts key cosmological parameters, including the Hubble constant (`H₀`) and the structure growth parameter (`S₈`), with zero free parameters.

## Key Results

The code in this repository reproduces the central findings of the paper:
- **Hubble Constant:** `H₀ = 73.63 ± 0.15 km/s/Mpc`
- **Structure Growth:** `S₈ = 0.758 ± 0.008`

## Repository Structure

- `src/` - Source code for numerical solvers and modified CLASS modules
- `scripts/` - Scripts to run calculations and generate plots
- `data/` - Output data and best-fit parameter files

## Usage

*(Instructions will be updated as the code is finalized.)*
